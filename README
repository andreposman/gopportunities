# Project Overview

This project includes scripts to create and delete job openings by interacting with a specified API endpoint. The Makefile provides convenient targets to run these scripts with the required parameters.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `curl` installed on your system.
- The API endpoint should be accessible and support the required HTTP methods (POST for creating and DELETE for deleting).

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

## Usage
1.**In the root folder run**:

```sh
   go run cmd/api/main.go
   ```
   or  

```sh   
   air
   ```


### Create Job Openings

1.**Navigate to the internal/db directory**:

   ```sh
   cd internal/db
   ```

To create a specified number of job openings, use the `create` target with the `USERS` parameter:

```sh
make create USERS=<number_of_users>
```

For example, to create 10 job openings:

```sh
make create USERS=10
```

### Delete Job Openings

To delete job openings within a specified ID range, use the `delete` target with the `START_ID` and `END_ID` parameters:

```sh
make delete START_ID=<start_id> END_ID=<end_id>
```

For example, to delete job openings with IDs from 1 to 10:

```sh
make delete START_ID=1 END_ID=10
```
